	/*
	 	Given an array of citations in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

		According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h 
		if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
		and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than hcitations each."
		
		Example:
		
		Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
		Output: 3 
		Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
		             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
		             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
		             two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
		Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
